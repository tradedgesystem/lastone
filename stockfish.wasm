This placeholder text exists because the build environment blocks network access. Please download the official Stockfish WASM binary and overwrite this file:

1. Download: https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/releases/latest/download/stockfish.wasm
2. Save it as stockfish.wasm in the extension root (same folder as manifest.json).

No code changes are needed after placing the binary.
